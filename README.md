My major project (individual) for Software Design and Development in Year 12 2020. I created a simple 'Motel Booking System' which allows users to check in and out of a hotel. This was one of my very first coding projects and holds a special place in my heart. YES there are a couple of errors, I wasn't the best :) this program was only the second ever time I used python in my life. 

How it works:

When you run the code, a window will appear where you either prompted to 'Check In', 'Check Out' or read about how to use the program. 

When you check in, you are asked to use your correct details and remember your room number as it is important for checking out! 

When you check out, simply type in the same name you used for check in, along with your specified room number! 

Thank you for using HBHS Motels!
